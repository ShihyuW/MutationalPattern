# MutationalPattern
This is a R package for analysizing mutational pattern of vcf files.
Under the basic structure of `Mutational Signature`, some customized modifications were made, including change the color setting of Relative contribution plot through `RColorBrewer` and adjust the code for enrichment/depletion analysis for multiple inputs.
